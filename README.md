# Password Strength Checker 🚀

This project is a **Password Strength Checker** built using **React.js**. It evaluates the strength of a user's password (Weak, Medium, Strong) based on various criteria like length, presence of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters. Additionally, it estimates the time required to crack the password using brute force.

## 🔥 Features
- Real-time password strength evaluation.
- Animated UI with a gradient background.
- Displays the time required to crack the password.
- User-friendly interface with smooth animations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React.js** for the frontend
- **CSS3** for styling and animations

## 📝 Deployment
- The project can be deployed on platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**.
- To deploy using **Vercel**:
  1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
  2. Import the repository to Vercel.
  3. Vercel will automatically deploy and provide a live link.

## 🤔 How it Works
- The password strength is determined based on:
  - Length of the password
  - Inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters
- Estimated time to crack the password is displayed based on character combinations.
